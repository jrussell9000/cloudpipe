  # Digests of the images pre-baked into the GPU AMI. These select the AMI (via
  # amiSelectorTerms) AND are what packer pulls, so they are the load-bearing
  # values here — the _tag values below are for human traceability only.
  #
  # Each MUST equal the digest pinned in the corresponding workflow template.
  # kubelet matches cached images by full reference string, so if these drift the
  # pre-bake is dead weight and every GPU node re-pulls at pod start. The
  # fastsurfer bake had drifted for ~2 months before #123; build-gpu-nodeclass-ami.yaml
  # now resolves both from ECR and warns when they disagree.
  #
  # Updated automatically by build-gpu-nodeclass-ami.yaml after each AMI build;
  # a terraform apply is still required to roll the nodeclass to the new AMI.
